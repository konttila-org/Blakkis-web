          App Purpose and Limitations
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Blakkis is specifically designed as a social drink tracking
          application, not a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) calculator. Our app:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Does NOT calculate Blood Alcohol Content</strong>: Blakkis
            does not attempt to measure or calculate your actual blood alcohol
            concentration.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does NOT provide medical measurements</strong>: The
            visualizations and data presented in the app are not clinical
            measurements and should not be treated as such.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does NOT indicate fitness to drive</strong>: Never use
            Blakkis to determine whether you are fit to drive, operate
            machinery, or engage in any activity that requires sobriety.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does NOT replace professional medical advice</strong>: The
            app cannot and does not attempt to predict your actual level of
            impairment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Blakkis is intended solely for{' '}
          <strong>
            personal tracking and social sharing of drink consumption patterns
          </strong>
          . The impact visualizations in the app are rough approximations based
          on self-reported data and general population models, which{' '}
          <strong>
            cannot account for individual physiological differences
          </strong>
          that affect how alcohol is processed by your body.

        <p className="mb-6">

          medical professionals. Never make health or safety decisions based on
